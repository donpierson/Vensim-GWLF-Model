# Vensim-GWLF-Model
This directory contain a hydrologic model inspired by the GWLF model coupled to a DOC stream water concentration model.  The two together allow screening level evaluations of watershed DOC loads.

The Original GWLF model was developed by D Haith at Cornell Univeristy

  Haith, D. A. and L. L. Shoemaker (1987). "Generalized Watershed Loading Functions for stream flow nutrients." Water Resources Bulletin 23(3): 471-478.
  
This was recoded into the visual modelling language Vensim (https://vensim.com/) and used extensively by the New York City Dept of Environmenatl Protectection to simulate nutrient and sediment load to NYC drinking water reservioirs

The Vensim version of GWLF was also used by the EU CLIME project

During CLIME the model was modified to also to simulate stream water DOC concentrations
