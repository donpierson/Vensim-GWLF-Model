Changes history
14/3/2022: Eleanor Jennings changed the reference temperature in the decomposition equation to 283oC (10oC).  This was a late change that Pam Naden made to the CLIME version but had not been included here.  When tested in CLIME this did not make any large difference, but seemed more logical than a reference temperature of 10oC
14/3/2022: Eleanor Jennings changed the DOC in streamflow equation to ‘IF THEN ELSE(gwflow>0,total DOC loss*100/(streamflow)*ZIDZ(SUM(AREA LU [lu DOC!]),(Watershed Area*100)),0)’ from IF THEN ELSE(gwflow>0,total DOC loss*100/(streamflow)*ZIDZ(SUM(AREA LU [lu DOC!]),Watershed Area),0). Watershed area in this model version is in km2 and not in ha as in the old model version.  The equation is now correct
16/03/2022: Ricardo Marroquin incorporated measured DOC (variable name: meas DOC) to the model for the calibration through the DOC .cin input file. The line: "DOC calib file name :IS: 'EXCEL FILE NAME'" was added to the DOC .cin input file. The excel file with measured DOC data is included in the folder.
16/03/2022: Ricardo Marroquin added the "DOC calib file name" and the "meas DOC" as displayed variables in the Optimizing sheet of the model.
16/03/2022: Ricardo Marroquin included in the folder the "MeasDOC_SimDOC_payoff.vdp" payoff of the example DOC optimization (as discussed on 16/03/2022) and the "Opt_DOC_Parameters.voc" of the example DOC optimization (as discussed on 16/03/2022).

	Fixed problem with channel Evap only occurring from water courses
	Now set the growing season to be calculated dynamically as a function of 5 day running mean air temp 
	and with a buffer period. 
	Added some additional Error calculations on a monthly time step
	Updated custom graphs, including plots of monthly sim and measured streamflow
	Improve hidden vs visible variable view of the hydrology model
	Put all optimization variables/calculations into a separate group
	Added a place to put last modified date in the information view (trying to avoid renaming the model too much)

    Now have added an additive Curve number correction factor that can be used to adjust the model runoff to 
    match that calculated from the hydrograph seperation based runoff.  This is done early in the calibration
    process to ensure that the total volume of simulated and measured runoff match.  Only curve nubers on 
	previous land use classes are adjusted.  Also continued to clean up the variable groupings and added
	a few more custom graphs

     Add a variable that defines the inital level of the deep sat zone.  Also a CIN file where some reasonble
     inital values of all soil zones are suggested.

	Added equations in the optimizing spreadsheet to: 1) import measured and interpolated DOC; 2) compute daily and monthly DOC loads 
	and 3) compute daily and monthly load residuals
	
	Added equations in the Error calc spreadshee to: 1) compute daily and monthly loads NSEs. The mean for this calculations has to be 
	set manually after a simulation but before optimization (the instructions are in the spreadsheet)

	Added to the DOC model the channel flow component

	Please check the INITIAL TIME and FINAL TIME for the simulations before running the model. If the simulations are meant for DOC simulations
	or optimizations, the current procedure involving daily and monthly loads RMS needs to be ran only for the period for which measured DOC is
	available.
